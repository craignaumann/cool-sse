# COOL-SSE

This app demonstrates SSE - Server Side Events. 

It is similar to websockets, but instead of having two way communication, the communication only flows one way. But instead of it being
from the client to the server, it is from the server to the client!

To run this example:
 - install dependencies
  ```
    npm install
    ```
 - start the server
  ```
    npm start [PORT]
    ```
 - Open web browser to localhost:[PORT]
